# Welcome to the BE programming test!

In this meeting we are trying to decide if you have the skills to work at our company.

This is a sails.js app that was generated with `sails new <my-app>`

## The bowling alley program!

Welcome to our virtual bowling alley!

Users line up at the bowling alley to rent shoes and play a game of bowling. Everyone wants to play but there are only so many pairs of shoes and only so many lanes to play! On top of that, the bowling alley only open for a total of 30 seconds. See how many customers you can allow to bowl.

## Goals of the test

Note: for step 1, you can use mock JSON data for everything

1. Get all of the tests to pass when you run `npm test`

2. You must save the bowlers in a databse of your choosing. All other data can be passed around as JSON only for testing purposes.

3. Create a simple express app for an endpoint that gets all users in the DB

4. Test this route with supertest from npm
